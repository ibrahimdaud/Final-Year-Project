# Final-Year-Project
This is my dissertation called "Toxic Twitter - Using Machine Learning to detect hate speech" coded in Python.
It is a hate speech detection model that provides a simple interface for users to search Twitter for hate speech. 
The interface will retrieve Twitter data and apply the learning algorithm to perform hate speech detection. 
This is operated by using a supervised machine learning approach that will train in the domain of hate speech. 
Various evaluation metrics have been executed to judge the model's performance whilst abundant error checking has been employed to improve user experience. 
The results achieved by the model suggest it can successfully distinguish between hate speech and non-hate speech whilst also providing a great interface to allow user to interact with Twitter.
